# FeaturedBetsWidget

This project contains the code written in completing the Digital Solutions Specialist Master's Course.

The project title is 'Creating a Widget for the Sky Bet iOS App'

# Running the project:

Firstly, the most recent version of Xcode will need to be installed onto a mac from here -> https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
This may take some time.

Once Xcode is installed, the project should be cloned. Copying and pasting the following code into your terminal will clone the project into you desktop directory:

cd ~/Desktop

git clone https://github.com/Hillryan95/FeaturedBetsWidget.git

Having cloned the project, locate the 'SBGWidget.xcodeproj' and open it.

From the top middle panel in Xcode, a simulator device can be selected. It is recommended to choose the iPhone 13 as this is a modern, standard sized device, but any from the list can be chosen.

Next, click the play button to the left of the simulator selection. This will run the project.

The simulator will load up on your mac and you can replicate the user journey within the simulator.
